# NLP_Project_Automatic Text Summarization Using NLP

Text summary is an important work in natural language processing that includes shrinking a document while retaining its most important information. In this project, we investigated the usage of the NLTK and spaCy libraries to create a text summarization system with a graphical user interface (GUI).

Today, everything is virtualized, and there is a large volume of textual data that is difficult to examine for variouspurposes. There are two types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. In extractive, the model extracts the main points, whereas in abstractive, the model generates the summaries. Text summarization is a one-time approach for comprehending andevaluating vast amounts of data included in text and files. For its packages and methods, it is best implemented using NLP. For automatic text summarization, reinforcement learning is alsoproposed, with neural networks used to estimate the Q value. Rouge is used to assess the modelâ€™s performance. In this case, NLTK (natural language toolkit) is one of the most powerfullibraries in NLP, and spacy is used to analyse and summarise a significant amount of data.

I have contributed in this project by building the GUI with Microsoft VS by which we create a simple, user-friendly summation system that would allow users to input text, generate a summary, and visualise the findings using a graphical user interface.
